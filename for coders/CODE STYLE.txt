Mikle's wishes:
- all function must contain doc string with: several sentences about "what do this function", sentence about input and output data 

Vladimir's wishes:
- Constants are named with a capital letter
- There should be no magic numbers in the code
- There must be 2 spaces before and after the functions
- Operators are obfuscated by spaces, except for the cases of defining default parameters
